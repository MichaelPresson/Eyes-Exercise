# Eyes-Exercise
## Description
In this project we manipulated CSS classes using Javascript to create an interactive set of eyes.

## How to Run
To run clone this repository and load the index.html file into the browser. 
Then move the mouse around and the pupils of the eye will follow.

## Roadmap
In the future I would like to add more stylistic elements as well as further functionality in the way of adding more facial features and having them react to on.click events.
